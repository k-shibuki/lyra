{# Decompose Prompt Template
   Parameters:
   - question: Research question to decompose into atomic claims
#}
You are an expert in information analysis. Decompose the following research question into verifiable atomic claims.

## Research Question
{{ question }}

## Task
Break down the question into atomic claims that can be independently verified.

## Output Schema
For each claim, provide the following in a JSON array:
- text: The claim content (in verifiable form)
- polarity: "positive" (asserting truth), "negative" (asserting falsity), "neutral" (neutral inquiry)
- granularity: "atomic" (cannot be further decomposed), "composite" (can be further decomposed)
- type: "factual", "causal", "comparative", "definitional", "temporal", "quantitative"
- keywords: List of keywords useful for searching
- hints: Verification hints (where to find information)

## Guidance for hints
hints should specify concrete source types:
- Good: "PubMed RCTs", "FDA approval documents", "Cochrane reviews"
- Bad: "search online", "check news"

## Example
[
  {
    "text": "GPT-4 was released in March 2023",
    "polarity": "positive",
    "granularity": "atomic",
    "type": "temporal",
    "keywords": ["GPT-4", "release", "2023"],
    "hints": ["OpenAI official announcements", "technology news archives"]
  }
]

## Requirements
- Each claim must be independently verifiable
- Avoid vague expressions; be specific
- Decompose composite questions into multiple atomic claims

Output JSON array only:
