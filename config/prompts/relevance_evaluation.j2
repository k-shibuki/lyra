{# Relevance Evaluation Prompt Template
   Parameters:
   - query: Research query
   - source_abstract: Abstract of the source paper
   - target_abstract: Abstract of the cited/target paper
#}
Read the following research query and two paper abstracts, then evaluate whether
the target paper could serve as **useful evidence or important background** for
answering the query or evaluating claims on a scale of 0-10.

## Query
{{ query }}

## Source Paper Abstract
{{ source_abstract }}

## Target Paper Abstract
{{ target_abstract }}

## Evaluation Criteria ("Usefulness")
- 10: Directly related to the query's core; can be used for verification, comparison, or supporting evidence (same question, outcome, hypothesis, key variables, data/methods)
- 7-9: Closely related field; useful as important background, related research, or methodology reference (close enough to serve as evaluation material)
- 4-6: Somewhat related but indirect/peripheral (supplementary background)
- 1-3: Slightly related
- 0: Unrelated

## Important Notes
- Do NOT determine "SUPPORTS/REFUTES" stance. Direction is not needed.
- Judge usefulness not just by topical proximity, but by whether it can serve as evaluation material.
- Respond with a single digit (0-10) only.
