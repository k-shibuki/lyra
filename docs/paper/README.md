- **Directory**: `docs/paper/design-theory/`
- **Focus**: Phase diagrams for human–AI development; observational theory of finalization and responsibility (RP as responsibility-fold point, Control Plane / Data Plane decomposition, falsifiability conditions)

### Notes

- These papers are intentionally separated because they target different venues and make different claims:
  - The **system paper** describes what Lyra is and how it works.
  - The **experience report** describes how Lyra was built under a constrained human capability model (cannot inspect implementation code).
  - The **design theory paper** provides a theoretical framework for describing phase transitions in human–AI collaborative development.
