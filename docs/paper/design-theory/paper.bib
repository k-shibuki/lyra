The methods take account of sampling variability in both the observed data and the estimated classification rates. The methods are illustrated in a case-control analysis of the association of antibiotic use during pregnancy with sudden infant death syndrome.},

The book is written with computer scientists and engineers in mind and is full of examples from computer systems, as well as manufacturing and operations research. Fun and readable, the book is highly approachable, even for undergraduates, while still being thoroughly rigorous and also covering a much wider span of topics than many queueing books. Readers benefit from a lively mix of motivation and intuition, with illustrations, examples and more than 300 exercises -- all while acquiring the skills needed to model, analyze and design large-scale systems with good performance and low cost. The exercises are an important feature, teaching research-level counterintuitive lessons in the design of computer systems. The goal is to train readers not only to customize existing analyses but also to invent their own.},

  abstract = {A new approach to safety, based on systems thinking, that is more effective, less costly, and easier to use than current techniques.             Engineering has experienced a technological revolution, but the basic engineering techniques applied in safety and reliability engineering, created in a simpler, analog world, have changed very little over the years. In this groundbreaking book, Nancy Leveson proposes a new approach to safety---more suited to today's complex, sociotechnical, software-intensive world---based on modern systems thinking and systems theory. Revisiting and updating ideas pioneered by 1950s aerospace engineers in their System Safety concept, and testing her new model extensively on real-world examples, Leveson has created a new approach to safety that is more effective, less expensive, and easier to use than current techniques.             Arguing that traditional models of causality are inadequate, Leveson presents a new, extended model of causation (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes, or STAMP), then shows how the new model can be used to create techniques for system safety engineering, including accident analysis, hazard analysis, system design, safety in operations, and management of safety-critical systems. She applies the new techniques to real-world events including the friendly-fire loss of a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter in the first Gulf War; the Vioxx recall; the U.S. Navy SUBSAFE program; and the bacterial contamination of a public water supply in a Canadian town. Leveson's approach is relevant even beyond safety engineering, offering techniques for ``reengineering'' any large sociotechnical system to improve safety and manage risk.},

It examines some complications in allocating resources between the two, particularly those introduced by the distribution of costs and benefits across time and space, and the effects of ecological interaction. Two general situations involving the development and use of knowledge in organizations are modeled. The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run. The possibility that certain common organizational practices ameliorate that tendency is assessed.},

The effectiveness of a ``modularization'' is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},

This experience report documents a 45-day project in which I---a PharmD/PhD statistician who cannot read Python code---built an operational MCP server (\textasciitilde 190k LOC including tests) using AI agents with zero human-written code. I could not inspect the implementation, so code review was impossible. After an initial failure where specification-driven development produced modules that "looked right but did not run," the project pivoted to an ADR-driven control plane governing a fast-changing data plane (code, tests). The control plane---decision logs (ADRs), policies (rules), procedures (commands), and quality gates---stabilized inter-module contracts and coordination. I describe this control plane's minimal components, how failures drove its evolution, and practical patterns for collaborating with AI agents without inspecting code.},
