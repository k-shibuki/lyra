# Research Report: DPP-4 Inhibitors as Add-on Therapy to Insulin

**Date**: 2026-01-06 17:25 JST  
**Task ID**: `task_e5c6f6a6`  
**Hypothesis**: DPP-4 inhibitors as add-on therapy for type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin therapy with HbA1c ≥7% improve glycemic control and have an acceptable safety profile.

---

## Verdict

**SUPPORTED** (Confidence: High)

The evidence consistently supports that DPP-4 inhibitors, when added to insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients with HbA1c ≥7%, improve glycemic control without significantly increasing hypoglycemia risk, weight gain, or other adverse events.

### Refuting Evidence (T1)

| Claim | Source |
|-------|--------|
| No significant refuting evidence was identified | — |

### Contextual/Comparative Notes

- GLP-1 RAs show superior effects on cardiovascular outcomes and renal endpoints compared to DPP-4 inhibitors
- GLP-1 RA treatment was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to DPP4i (HR: 0.65)
- These comparisons do not refute DPP-4i efficacy but suggest GLP-1 RAs may be preferred in certain patient populations

## Unresolved Contradictions

- Minor controversy scores detected (0.07-0.10) but no clinically significant contradictions
- All evidence sources converge on supporting the hypothesis

## Conclusion

The hypothesis is **SUPPORTED** with high confidence. Multiple systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials consistently demonstrate that:

1. **Efficacy**: DPP-4 inhibitors added to insulin therapy significantly reduce HbA1c (average reduction 0.36-0.74%)
2. **Hypoglycemia**: No increased risk compared to placebo; lower risk compared to sulfonylureas
3. **Weight**: Neutral effect on body weight
4. **Cardiovascular**: No increased cardiovascular risk; some data suggest potential benefit
5. **Overall Safety**: Acceptable safety profile with fewer adverse events than insulin monotherapy

### Clinical Implications

DPP-4 inhibitors represent a safe and effective add-on option for type 2 diabetes patients on insulin therapy with suboptimal glycemic control (HbA1c ≥7%), particularly when:
- Weight gain is a concern
- Hypoglycemia risk needs to be minimized
- Oral therapy is preferred over injectable alternatives

### Limitations

- GLP-1 RAs may offer superior cardiovascular and renal protection in high-risk patients
- Long-term (>5 years) outcome data remain limited
- Heart failure risk with saxagliptin requires consideration (SAVOR-TIMI data)
