# Research Report: DPP-4 Inhibitors as Add-on Therapy to Insulin

**Date**: 2026-01-07 01:35 JST  
**Task ID**: `task_2457ff83`  
**Hypothesis**: DPP-4 inhibitors as add-on therapy for type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin therapy with HbA1c ≥7% improve glycemic control and have an acceptable safety profile.

- ⚠️ A significant portion of claims lack explicit publication year metadata
- ⚠️ Some safety claims (pancreatitis risk, heart failure concerns) require close pharmacovigilance monitoring

## Individual DPP-4 Inhibitors Studied

Evidence was collected for multiple DPP-4 inhibitors:
- **Sitagliptin** (FDA approved 2006)
- **Vildagliptin** (EU approved 2007)
- **Saxagliptin** (FDA approved 2009)
- **Linagliptin** (FDA approved 2011)
- **Alogliptin**

All showed consistent benefits when added to insulin therapy.

## Mechanism of Action

DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycemic control through:
1. Inhibiting the degradation of endogenous GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1)
2. Increasing insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner
3. Decreasing glucagon levels
4. Improving sensitivity of islet cells to glucose

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly supports that **DPP-4 inhibitors as add-on therapy for type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin therapy with HbA1c ≥7% improve glycemic control and have an acceptable safety profile**. 

Key benefits include:
- Significant HbA1c reduction (-0.54%)
- Reduced fasting and postprandial glucose levels
- Decreased daily insulin requirements
- No increased risk of hypoglycemia
- Weight neutrality
- Cardiovascular safety (non-inferior to placebo in CVOTs)

The combination is particularly beneficial for patients not achieving target glycemic control on insulin alone, offering an oral add-on option that simplifies the treatment regimen without compromising safety.
