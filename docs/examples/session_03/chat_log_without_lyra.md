**User**

You are advising a clinician who needs to choose an add-on therapy for a type 2 diabetes patient on insulin with HbA1c ≥7%.

**Compare DPP-4 inhibitors vs SGLT2 inhibitors:**

1. Which has better cardiovascular outcomes?
2. Which has lower hypoglycemia risk?
3. Which is more favorable for body weight?

Cite primary sources.

I'll search for the latest clinical evidence comparing these two drug classes for your patient scenario.

Let me search for more specific primary trial data to provide you with proper citations.

Based on the available evidence from cardiovascular outcome trials, here is a comprehensive comparison:

## DPP-4 Inhibitors vs SGLT2 Inhibitors: Clinical Comparison

### 1. Cardiovascular Outcomes

| Drug Class | Finding | Primary Evidence |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **SGLT2 Inhibitors** | **Superior** - Significant reduction in CV mortality, all-cause mortality, and heart failure hospitalization | EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58 |
| **DPP-4 Inhibitors** | Neutral on MACE; possible ↑ HF hospitalization risk (saxagliptin) | SAVOR-TIMI 53, EXAMINE, TECOS, CARMELINA |

**Key data:**
- SGLT2 inhibitors reduce **cardiovascular mortality** (NNT = 48), **all-cause mortality** (NNT = 43), and **hospitalization for heart failure** (NNT = 19) vs placebo¹
- A network meta-analysis found SGLT2 inhibitors associated with **33–35% lower risk of HF hospitalization** and **10–14% lower risk of MI/stroke** compared to DPP-4 inhibitors²
- DPP-4 inhibitors show **no reduction in MACE or CV death** versus placebo; saxagliptin (SAVOR-TIMI 53) showed a 27% increased risk of HF hospitalization³

**Winner: SGLT2 inhibitors**

### 2. Hypoglycemia Risk

| Drug Class | Hypoglycemia Risk | Mechanism |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **DPP-4 Inhibitors** | **Low** (0.6–6.6% as monotherapy; ~25% when combined with insulin/SUs) | Glucose-dependent insulin secretion |
| **SGLT2 Inhibitors** | **Low** (comparable to DPP-4i) | Insulin-independent mechanism (glucosuria) |

Both classes have **similarly low intrinsic hypoglycemia risk** because their mechanisms are glucose-dependent or insulin-independent. However, when added to insulin, both may require insulin dose reduction.

**Winner: Comparable (tie)**

### 3. Body Weight Effects

| Drug Class | Effect on Weight | Magnitude |
|------------|------------------|-----------|
| **SGLT2 Inhibitors** | **Weight loss** | ~2–3 kg reduction (due to urinary glucose excretion)⁴ |
| **DPP-4 Inhibitors** | **Weight-neutral** | No significant change⁵ |

**Winner: SGLT2 inhibitors**

## Summary Recommendation

| Parameter | Better Option |
|-----------|---------------|
| CV outcomes | **SGLT2 inhibitors** |
| Hypoglycemia risk | **Equivalent** |
| Body weight | **SGLT2 inhibitors** |

For a T2DM patient on insulin with HbA1c ≥7%, **SGLT2 inhibitors are generally preferred**, particularly if the patient has:
- Established cardiovascular disease or heart failure
- Overweight/obesity
- Concern for weight gain on insulin

**Caution with SGLT2 inhibitors:** Monitor for diabetic ketoacidosis (rare), genital mycotic infections, and volume depletion (especially in elderly or those on diuretics).
