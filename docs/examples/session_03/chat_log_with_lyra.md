**User**

You are advising a clinician who needs to choose an add-on therapy for a type 2 diabetes patient on insulin with HbA1c ≥7%.

**Compare DPP-4 inhibitors vs SGLT2 inhibitors:**

1. Which has better cardiovascular outcomes?
2. Which has lower hypoglycemia risk?
3. Which is more favorable for body weight?

First, query the Lyra Evidence Graph to retrieve relevant claims from previous research sessions. 
Cite primary sources.

**Cursor**

I'll query the Lyra Evidence Graph to retrieve relevant claims on DPP-4 inhibitors vs SGLT2 inhibitors across the three clinical dimensions you mentioned.

Let me get the full evidence chains with source citations for these key claims.

Based on the Lyra Evidence Graph, here is a clinical comparison:

## DPP-4 Inhibitors vs SGLT2 Inhibitors as Add-On to Insulin

### 1. Cardiovascular Outcomes

**SGLT2 inhibitors are superior.**

| Outcome | SGLT2 Inhibitors | DPP-4 Inhibitors |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| MACE | **Reduced** (11.4 vs 16.5 events/1000 person-years) | Neutral |
| Heart Failure Hospitalization | **HR 0.65** (95% CI 0.59–0.72) | Conflicting evidence |
| All-cause Mortality | Reduced | Neutral |

**Key claims from evidence graph:**

> *"SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a lower risk of major heart problems in patients with type 2 diabetes than DPP-4 inhibitors."*  
> — BMJ Comparative Study ([EurekAlert, 2019](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/691284))

> *"SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with reduced risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.59-0.72) overall and both in those with CVD (HR 0.78) and without CVD (HR 0.53)."*  
> — [Diabetes Obes Metab. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.14893) (DOI: 10.1111/dom.14893)

> *"The impact of DPP-4 inhibitors on heart failure outcomes in patients with diabetes remains contentious, with conflicting evidence from clinical trials and observational studies."*  
> — [Medicina 2024](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina60121986) (DOI: 10.3390/medicina60121986)

### 2. Hypoglycemia Risk

**Both classes have low hypoglycemia risk; DPP-4 inhibitors have stronger insulin add-on data.**

| Class | Hypoglycemia Risk When Added to Insulin |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| DPP-4 Inhibitors | **Low** — well-documented in multiple meta-analyses |
| SGLT2 Inhibitors | **Low** — insulin-independent mechanism |

**Key claims:**

> *"DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycemic control with a low risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain."*  
> — Multiple sources including:
> - [DMSO 2019 Meta-analysis](https://doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S202024)
> - [Nature Sci Rep 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep44865)
> - [BMJ 2012](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.e1369)

> *"DPP-4 inhibitors combined with insulin therapy reducing the incidence of hypoglycemia."*  
> — [Diab Metab Syndr Obes 2019](https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=52172)

> *"DPP-4 inhibitors are effective and safe as add-on therapy for type 2 diabetes patients receiving insulin therapy with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥7%)"*  
> — Supported by 10+ independent sources in the evidence graph

### 3. Body Weight

**SGLT2 inhibitors are favorable (weight loss); DPP-4 inhibitors are weight-neutral.**

| Class | Effect on Body Weight |
|-------|-----------------------|
| SGLT2 Inhibitors | **Weight reduction** (~2–3 kg) |
| DPP-4 Inhibitors | **Weight-neutral** (no gain or loss) |

**Key claims:**

> *"SGLT2i/DPP4i resulted in greater weight reduction compared to PCB/DPP4i."*  
> — [Sci Rep 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22658-2)

> *"SGLT2 inhibitors are now fundamental parts of weight-loss regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes."*  
> — [SAS J Med 2024](https://doi.org/10.36347/sasjm.2024.v10i12.001)

> *"Patients treated in combination treatment revealed the favorable effects on body weight and systolic BP compared to subjects on DPP-4 inhibitors."*  
> — [Lipids Health Dis 2017](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-017-0443-4)

> *"DPP-4 inhibitors are weight-neutral and well-tolerated but may lose efficacy over time."*  
> — Evidence graph (multiple sources)

## Clinical Summary

| Criterion | Preferred Agent | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Cardiovascular protection** | **SGLT2 inhibitor** | High |
| **Hypoglycemia safety** | Both equivalent | High |
| **Weight management** | **SGLT2 inhibitor** | High |

### Recommendation

For a **type 2 diabetes patient on insulin with HbA1c ≥7%**, **SGLT2 inhibitors** offer a superior clinical profile due to:
- Proven cardiovascular and heart failure benefits
- Comparable hypoglycemia safety
- Additional weight loss benefit

**Caveats:** Monitor for genital mycotic infections and diabetic ketoacidosis (rare). DPP-4 inhibitors remain a reasonable alternative when SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated (e.g., recurrent UTIs, severe renal impairment with eGFR <20).
